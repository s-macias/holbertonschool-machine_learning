    Function that builds, trains, and saves a neural network classifier:
    Arguments:
    X_train is a numpy.ndarray containing the training input data
    Y_train is a numpy.ndarray containing the training labels
    X_valid is a numpy.ndarray containing the validation input data
    Y_valid is a numpy.ndarray containing the validation labels
    layer_sizes is a list containing the number of nodes in each layer of the
    network
    activations is a list containing the activation functions for each layer of
    the network
    alpha is the learning rate
    iterations is the number of iterations to train over
    save_path designates where to save the model

    Add the following to the graphâ€™s collection
     - placeholders x and y
     - tensors y_pred, loss, and accuracy
     - operation train_op
    After every 100 iterations, the 0th iteration, and iterations iterations,
    print the following:
    - After {i} iterations: where i is the iteration
    - \tTraining Cost: {cost} where {cost} is the training cost
    - \tTraining Accuracy: {accuracy} where {accuracy} is the training accuracy
    - \tValidation Cost: {cost} where {cost} is the validation cost
    - \tValidation Accuracy: {accuracy} where {accuracy} is the validation
    accuracy
    Reminder: the 0th iteration represents the model before any training has
    occurred
    After training has completed, save the model to save_path
    You may use the following imports:
